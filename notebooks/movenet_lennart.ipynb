The model is offered on [TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?q=movenet) with two variants, known as Lightning and Thunder. Lightning is intended for latency-critical applications, while Thunder is intended for applications that require high accuracy. Both models run faster than real time (30+ FPS) on most modern desktops, laptops, and phones, which proves crucial for live fitness, health, and wellness applications.\n",
